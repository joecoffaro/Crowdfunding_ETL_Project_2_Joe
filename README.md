# Crowdfunding_ETL


In this project, our group built an ETL pipeline to extract and transform crowdfunding data. Four csv files were generated and used to create an ERD and table schema. All csv files were put into a Postgres database. (Python, Pandas, Python dictionary methods and regular expressions were used to complete this project).

The schema of the Postgres database, created using [quickdatabasediagrams.com](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/):
